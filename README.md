Brain Tumor Classification (Ensemble CNN)

This project classifies brain MRI images into:

      Meningioma
  
      Glioma    
  
      Pituitary Tumor

It uses an ensemble of:

    Xception
    
    EfficientNetB0
    
    ResNet50

Their features are combined and passed through custom layers for final prediction.
